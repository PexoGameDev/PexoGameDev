        <h2 style="margin:0">So what can I do?</h2>
            <p>
              <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Programming</h3>
                ♢ For nearly two years now I am working with <span class="highlight">Unity3D</span> game engine, using <span class="highlight">C#</span> language and this is my go-to toolset.
                <br>
                ♢ My favourite branches of game-dev programming are both <span class="highlight">gameplay programming</span> and <span class="highlight">AI programming</span>, and I love to work on either.
                <br>
                ♢ I wrote some non-Unity C# code, like project Euler exercises or very small Invoice program with databases but I ain't no pro.
                <br>
                ♢ I also have some basic knowladge of <span class="highlight">C++</span> (I <i>tried</i> to write some clone of <a class="project-link" href="http://github.com/pexogamedev/Cpp-Space-Invaders">Space Invaders in CMD</a> using it).
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Version Control</h3>
                ♢ If you haven't already, I recommend you to take a look at my <a class="project-link" href="http://github.com/pexogamedev">GitHub profile</a>. I belive its existance confirms that I also can use <span class="highlight">git version control</span>.
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Languages</h3>
                ♢ I can mumble something in my <span class="highlight">native Polish</span> language.
                <br>
                ♢ I also am pretty <span class="highlight">advanced in English</span>, both in writing and speech. 
                <br>
                ♢ I even have some <span class="highlight">elementary</span> knowladge of <span class="highlight">Japanese</span>.
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Design & Soft Skills</h3>
                ♢ I have been a game master for Pen&Paper RPG tabletop games for over 4 years so I have some skill in <span class="highlight">characters, quests and story design</span> as well as in <span class="highlight">working with a group</span>.
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Web Development</h3>
                ♢ I had some adventure with web-dev so I do know, to some extent, <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS, JavaScript </span>and<span class="highlight"> PHP</span>. This very website was build by me (<a class="project-link" href="http://pexogamedev.pl/project/pexogamedev.php">mostly</a>).
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Databases</h3>
                ♢ I created an online private galleries system with administrator's panel and it required a lot of fiddling with databases so I have some CRUDe (get it?) knowladge about <span class="highlight">SQL & MySQL </span>
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Graphics and Video Editing</h3>
                ♢ While working on <a href="http://pexogamedev.pl/project/nn.php" class="project-link">Neon Nebula</a>, my first finished game, I had to deal with creating sprites for the game so I learned 
                <span class="highlight">Adobe Photoshop</span> a little. <br>
                ♢ I know how to use <span class="highlight">Adobe Premiere</span> and <span class="highlight">Adobe After Effects</span>. I even did some <a class="project-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QpaxPW3EA0">cool stuff</a> with it, you can check it out on my <a class="project-link" href="http://youtube.com/user/PexoGames
                ">YouTube channel</a>.
                <br><br>

                <h3 style="margin:0; text-decoration:underline" class="">Other IT-Related Skills</h3>
                ♢ After graduating high school I am certified IT Specialst.<br>
                ♢ I own 4 Cisco's CCNA Routing and Switching certificates:<br>
                    <span style="padding-left:2em">❖ Introduction to Networks</span><br>
                    <span style="padding-left:2em">❖ Scaling Networks</span><br>
                    <span style="padding-left:2em">❖ Connecting Networks</span><br>
                    <span style="padding-left:2em">❖ Routing and Switching Essentials</span><br>
                So i know <i>some</i> basic stuff about networking too.
                <br><br>
                <i style="font-size:0.9em">Except for all things mentioned I, obviously, know Jujutsu, Karate, Aikido, Taekwondo and some more scary soudning words! ;)</i>
