            <h1>About Me</h1>
        </div>
        <i>TL;DR; I live in Poland and want to make games professionally in the future.</i><br /><br />
            <p style="text-align:justify;">

                &#9672; I was born in the same year as first Half-Life came out, which makes me younger than 2 decades (yet). I wanted to create video games since I remember and it is still a goal of my career.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                &#9672; For several months, now, I was working with Unity in C# and I eventually managed to develop my <a href="http://neonnebula.pexogamedev.pl">first "fully playable" game</a>. 
                Right now I'm working on another, small project of my own,
                but I also have gotten involved in bigger, more professional, project in which I became a part of the team.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                &#9672; Programming is my main niche and in the future I aspire to be an AI specialist, althought, I've got to admit, that the thing I love most in whole game development process is designing. (Kudos to best stories and characters!)
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                &#9672; Except for games and gamedev my hobbies are <span title="If it matters anything to you I'm enneagram's five and MBTI's INTP">psychology</span>, all branches of science (especially math and quantum physics) and self-development. 
            </p>

            &#9672; I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> library to set up this website. I also used <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> with <a href="http://bestweblayout.com/products/cybergames/">Cyber Games</a> layout for Neon Nebula's website.<br /><br />
            &#9672; I'm familiar with video editing software such as Adobe Premiere or Adobe After Efects. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QpaxPW3EA0">I did this!</a>)<br /><br />

            &#9672; I'm active gamer, I trully do love playing games just as much as creating them. It's my lifelong passion.<br /><br />

                <h1>Why Do I Want To Make Games?</h1>
            </div>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Common question, and, in my opinion, the most important one, is "<b>WHY</b> do you want to make games?". I belive that anyone who had to answer this type of "Why" question is already aware that it's very hard to simply answer it in most of cases... But anyways,
                so... me personally? I do want to make games because:
            </p>

            <p>
                &#9672;       I want to create worlds into which other people will be able to dive, forget about daily problems, struggles and pains.
                <br />&#9672; I want to create amazing, breathtaking places which others can admire in pure awe.
                <br />&#9672; I want to create lively, true, characters with deep personalities, to which others can relate and/or create bonds with them.
                <br />&#9672; I want to create stories, which will cause people to smile, cry, scream and dream(BIG!).
                <br />&#9672; I want to create great moments, which will remain for long time in minds of players, and will bring grin upon their faces everytime they recall them.
                <br />
            </p>
            <h3 style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">
                I want to make OUR WORLD more fascinating and less formidable place. <br /> In games everyone, literally, is a hero
                of his own story, and I want to bring more of feelings like this to people.
