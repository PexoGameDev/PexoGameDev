    <p class="highlight" style="font-size:150%; text-align: center; margin-top:0px"> My goal is to make people heroes of their own stories. </p>
  Today's world is a formidable place. Way too often we struggle with stress, fear or low self-confidence. Not many of us feel like they are in control of their lives.
  <p class="highlight">I belive that this has to change.</p>
  I decided <u>my mission</u> will be to make the world a brighter, better, less scary place. And I hope to achive that by developing games that will be something more than just a way to kill some time. I want to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Build charming worlds into which others could dive, forgetting about daily problems and struggles</li>
  <li>Bring to life unique, true characters with deep, real personalities to which people could relate.</li>
  <li>Orchestrate great scenes which would bring smiles upon players' faces and remain with them for a long time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <span style="font-size: 2em">Anyways...</span> where are my manners? Let me introduce myself. My name is <span class="highlight">Owczarz Patryk</span>, much more often known as  <span class="highlight">Pexo</span>. 
  I live in Poland, and I am just about to finish high school.</p><p> I proudly represent a healthy mix of geekiness and nerdiness in one person. What does that mean? Well... 
  My hobbies include, but are not limited to: <span class="highlight">self-development, psychology, computer science, artificial inteligence, quantum physics, neuroscience; Pen&Paper RPGs, character design, story writing and giving speeches.</span>  
</p>
<p>
  Obviously, except for all mentioned above I'm <s>also intrested in</s> passionate about <span class="highlight">game development, game design (primarily character design), AI and gameplay programming</span> and basically everything that relates to game development or games themselves.
</p>
<p>
  Also I always wear hoodies, I love t-shirts with witty printings, my favourite animals are squirells and hamsters, my favourite food is sushi and, fun fact, sometimes I'm funny... No, really!

  <h2 class="highlight" style="margin-bottom:10px">But first of all - I am a gamer</h2>

  <span title="There is No Game">I know that "There is no game" is actually a game.<br /></span>
  <span title="Life is Strange">I know that Life is <s>Strange</s> so unfair.<br /></span>
  <span title="Overwatch">I know that heroes never die.<br /></span>
  <span title="Dungeones & Dragons or Pathfinder">I know how to use 20 sided dice to kill goblin in 1337 ways.<br /></span>
  <span title="TES: Skyrim">I was an advernturer, just like everyone else, but then I took an arrow in the knee.<br /></span>
  <span title="Starcraft II">I have heard already <b>a few</b> times that we require more minerals.<br /></span>
  <span title="Basically every shooter ever">Ammo 199/200? Time to reload.</span><br /><br />
  <span title="Did you find hidden titles? ;)">Eeyup. That's all me.</span><br>
